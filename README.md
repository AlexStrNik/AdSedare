# AdSedare

*(from Latin **"Ad Sedare"** â€” *to calm*)*

**AdSedare** is a Ruby library that makes iOS **ad-hoc distribution** smooth and stress-free. With AdSedare, you can stop dealing with the chaotic mess of:

- Manually adding every new tester device across countless ad-hoc profiles
- Keeping certificate capabilities and app group settings in sync
- Regenerating expired provisioning profiles one painful click at a time
- Writing clunky shell scripts to build keychains or install profiles from App Store
- Patching `xcodeproj` files to support ad-hoc builds, then reverting everything for production

AdSedare does all of this for you. It reads your Xcode project, understands its structure, and automates the entire profile and signing setup. It can even register new bundle IDs and request fresh provisioning profiles on the fly.

## Why the Name?

The name **AdSedare** comes from personal suffering.

After over a year of managing internal iOS testing by hand, I was completely fried. Iâ€™d wrestled with Fastlane and similar tools, and while powerful, they were often too rigid or bloated for the very specific pain of ad-hoc distribution. So I built something with a **single mission**:
Make internal iOS testing **as chill as a cucumber in a snowstorm**.

## Docs

Right now, AdSedare is provided as a **Ruby library**, with plans to add CLI support later this year (â„¢).

### `Adsedare::renew_profiles(project_path = nil, certificate_id = nil, team_id = nil)`

This is the **crown jewel** of the library.

- Traverses all targets in your `.xcodeproj`
- Inspects capabilities and entitlements
- Creates or renews **all necessary provisioning profiles**
- Adds any missing test devices
- Works with `APPLE_DEVELOPER_USERNAME` and `APPLE_DEVELOPER_PASSWORD` (due to App Store Connect API being... _gently nerfed into the ground_)
- Handles 2FA with a **scriptable interface** â€” meaning you can hook in an SMS relay or similar system to auto-respond
- Stores sessions for up to \~2 weeks to avoid repeated logins

### `patch_project(project_path, team_id = nil)`

Need to prep your Xcode project for ad-hoc builds? This does it cleanly:

- Fetches correct provisioning profile names
- Applies them to each target's `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER`
- Optionally overwrites `team_id` if provided
- **Does NOT** use username/password â€” instead, expects:

  - `APPSTORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID`
  - `APPSTORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`
  - `APPSTORE_CONNECT_KEY`

This makes it more CI-friendly and avoids the 2FA headache entirely.

### `install_profiles(project_path = nil)`

- Downloads and installs all ad-hoc profiles needed by your project
- Places them in the correct location for Xcode to pick up
- Warns you if profiles are missing or expired
- Requires the same Connect API credentials as `patch_project`

### `create_keychain(keychain_path = nil, keychain_password = nil, make_default = true)`

**Arguably the second most powerful** feature, built from many hours of trial, error, and mild mental anguish.

- Creates a dedicated build keychain
- Imports required certificate chains and partition settings
- If provided with `AD_HOC_CERTIFICATE`, `AD_HOC_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `AD_HOC_KEY_PASSWORD`, will add your ad-hoc distribution cert too

ðŸ’¡ This function deliberately **does not** pull certificates from App Store Connect (unlike `match`) â€” because:

- You canâ€™t download private keys from Apple
- Recreating certs in CI constantly is a _certified bad ideaâ„¢_
- Relying on third-party key storage wasnâ€™t a hill I wanted to die on

### `make_export_options(project_path = nil, export_path = nil, team_id = nil, options = {})`

Creates a ready-to-use `exportOptions.plist`:

- Automatically fills in correct profile names (fetched from App Store Connect)
- Adds sensible defaults
- Supports optional overrides like `thinning`, `compileBitcode`, etc.

## Final Words

**AdSedare isnâ€™t here to replace Fastlane.**
But it _is_ here to offer a lighter, simpler alternative for **one very specific â€” but very common â€” pain**: ad-hoc iOS testing.

Itâ€™s already running in production and saving devs real time and real headaches. If you find a bug or have an idea, feel free to open an issue or PR â€” Iâ€™ll be more than happy to help.
